This is a simple terminal-based chatbot built using Python. It's designed to interact like a virtual friend — answering questions, responding with emotions, telling jokes, and even sharing the current time or date.

##  Features

- Responds to basic greetings (hello, hi, hey)
- Answers questions like "What’s your name?" or "How are you?"
- Handles emotional replies like "I’m feeling bad" or "I'm happy"
- Shows the current date and time
- Has custom goodbye messages (like "adieu" or "peace out")
- Friendly, human-like responses for casual conversations

 How It Works

The chatbot uses a simple rule-based system. It checks if certain keywords or phrases are present in your message, and then returns a matching response.

There are two main Python files:

- `main.py` — runs the conversation loop
- `Chatbotlogic.py` — handles all the logic for replies

## How to Run

1. Open the project in **PyCharm** (or any Python IDE)
2. Make sure both `main.py` and `Chatbotlogic.py` are in the same folder
3. Open the terminal and run:

```bash
python main.py
